## AI based smoke detector using ADABoost and Backpropagation methods

The dataset and its description are as follows:
•	Unnamed 0 – Unique identifier
•	UTC - The time when experiment was performed.
•	Temperature - Temperature of Surroundings. Measured in Celsius
•	Humidity - The air humidity during the experiment.
•	TVOC - Total Volatile Organic Compounds. Measured in ppb (parts per billion)
•	eCo2 - CO2 equivalent concentration. Measured in ppm (parts per million)
•	Raw H2 - The amount of Raw Hydrogen present in the surroundings.
•	Raw Ethanol - The amount of Raw Ethanol present in the surroundings.
•	Pressure - Air pressure. Measured in hPa
•	PM1.0 - Paticulate matter of diameter less than 1.0 micrometer .
•	PM2.5 - Paticulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometer.
•	NC0.5 - Concentration of particulate matter of diameter less than 0.5 micrometers.
•	NC1.0 - Concentration of particulate matter of diameter less than 1.0 micrometers.
•	NC2.5 - Concentration of particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. target: 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
•	CNT - Simple Count.
•	Fire Alarm - (Reality) If fire was present then value is 1 else it is 0.
