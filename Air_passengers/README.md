## Determine the number of passengers travelling at different time using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

The dataset is based on passengers that travelled for different time. The dataset and its description are as follows:
Month: Year and month of travel
#Passengers: Number of passengers that travelled

Our goal here is to find the number of passengers that might travel by flights based on the previous frequency of travel by passengers.
