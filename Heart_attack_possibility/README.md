## Determine the heart attack possibility of a patient using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Dataset is based on heart attack possibility for a patient. The dataset and its description are as follows:
age: age of the patient
sex: Gender of the patient
cp: chest pain type
trestbps: resting blood pressure
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise induced angina
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
target: 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
